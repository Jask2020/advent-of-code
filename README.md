Advent of code 2020 in Python/C++

[Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about)

Aim of this project is to implement programming concepts on various puzzles and expose common bugs and ill thinking.

Day 1: Solved using a two pointer approach

Day 2: Solved with string parsing using regular expressions

Day 3: Hacked together a solution normally, no clever approaches

Day 4: Solved with string parsing again,, regular expressions made it easy

Day 5: Solved by maintaining a divided list, could've been done easier just by conversion to binary

Day 6: Solved again by string parsing

Day 7: Dictionary solving

Day 8: Simple problem, did not require much thinking

Day 9: Contiguous subarray problem, took a while to solve

Day 10: Solved with normal code and dynamic programming (memoization)

Day 11: Solved in a brute-forcey way by calculating all time steps. Part 1 could've been done more cleverly by considering an adjacency array instead of manually checking

Day 12: Vector rotation problem, essentially a velocity/position solution.

Day 13: Solved using Chinese Remainder Theorem. Another math problem.

Day 14: Solved using bitmasking and recursion

Day 15: Solved with just the proper order of indexing and updating. Array solution took O(n) time, so had to use maps for the second part for O(log n) implementation
